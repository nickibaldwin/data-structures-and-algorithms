# Code Challenge Class 05 - Linked List

<!-- TODO:  -->
## Challenge Summary

Implement a Singly Linked List

## Challenge Description

Create a Node class and Linked List. Handle custom errors, semantic errors that describe what went wrong in calling the methods written. Finally, write tests to prove the following functionality:

- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

<!-- TO DO ADD THIS TO PR COMMENT -->
## Task List:

- [ ] Create a Node class that has properties and a pointer to the next Node.
- [ ] Linked List class includes a a head property. Upon instantiation, en empty Linked List should be created.
  - [ ] Define a methods called **insert()** which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that vakue to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  - [ ] Define a method called **includes()** which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- [ ] Define a method called **toString()** which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
  - "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
- [ ] Error - Handlers
- [ ] Tests
  - [ ] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
  - [ ] Can properly insert into the linked list
  - [ ] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
  - [ ] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
  - [ ] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
  - [ ] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
  - [ ] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
